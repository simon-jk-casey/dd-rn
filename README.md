# React Native Redux Boiler

This is a boilerplate project for a React Native application that uses Redux to manage state. Note that I use [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) for debugging, which I highly recommend as a way to visualize the redux logic in your application. I do my best to keep this updated with the latest version of React Native.

The boilerplate also includes linting with [Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard), and a skeleton testing suite with [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava).
## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/breezykermo/react-native-redux-boiler my-project

brew update && brew cask install react-native-debugger
npm i -g yarn
npm i -g react-native-debugger-open
yarn   #install dependencies: can also use 'npm install'

#run the app on iOS simulator
